                       It is a software application that helps grocery store owners manage their inventory of products. It typically involves creating a database of products, managing stock levels, maintaining vendor information and managing user access details. A scheduler is implemented to check the stock levels periodically and email the store owner.
                       The application uses Spring Data JPA for database access, Spring Security for authentication and authorization, Spring RESTful API that enables the front-end application to communicate with the back-end and React.js for Frontend.
